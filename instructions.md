  ## Lab 1
  ### Configure a Logic App Standard as a API Management backend for writing messages on service bus
  #### Steps
  1. From the logicapp-1-xxxx, deploy and configure (trigger and actions) so our worklfow be able to receive requests from the API Management instance.

     The request body is 
    {
    "nombre": "string",
    "apellido": "string",
    "direccion":"string",
    "contacto":"string"
    }

  2. In the "parameters" section of the "Compose" action, configure the input, including with the above mentioned body.
  3. Using the Service Bus "Send Message" connector, add an action for send messages to the Service Bus instance. Configure the nanmespace connection with the managed identity assigned to        the logic app and that was automatically generated by the deployment.

     To configure the Service bus connection from the Azure Portal:

     Go to the Service bus instance >> Shared Access Policies >> RootManageSharedAccessKey >> Primary Connection String

     Once the configuration is done, our action shape on the logic app will look like this:

  4. Add and configure a "Response" action:
     
  5. In the body add outputs('Compose')?['order_id']
  6. Finally, we will have the following workfloW:
  7. Save the changes.
  8. Copy the logic app URL.
  9. Divide the URL in two parts.

#### Complete URL
    
https://logicapp-1-3obbnrwlgsmby.azurewebsites.net:443/api/apimtriggersb/triggers/When_a_HTTP_request_is_received/invoke?api-version=2022-05-01&sp=%2Ftriggers%2FWhen_a_HTTP_request_is_received%2Frun&sv=1.0&sig=G6Mm5OvSduxJQaa8c09awMfvoJbqZgTrBOT_GUUFQ1A

#### Part 1:
https://logicapp-1-3obbnrwlgsmby.azurewebsites.net:443

#### Part 2: 
/api/apimtriggersb/triggers/When_a_HTTP_request_is_received/invoke?api-version=2022-05-01&sp=%2Ftriggers%2FWhen_a_HTTP_request_is_received%2Frun&sv=1.0&sig=G6Mm5OvSduxJQaa8c09awMfvoJbqZgTrBOT_GUUFQ1A

 10. From the APIS section from our API Management instance, click in "+ Add API >> HTTP >> fill the name and URL (Part 1 of the above URL) and then click in "Create".
 11. From our new API, click in "+ Add operatio" and complete the information as below indicates. To the URL field, select the "POST" method and the Part 2 of the URL.
 12. Save the changes.
 13. Test the "POST" method in the "Test" section of out API Management instance. We can also test it with Postman.
 14. Verify that we can obtarin 200 HTTP response and that the message is suscribed on the "orders" Service bus topic.
 15.
